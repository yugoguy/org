      "As a 20-year-old male who is somewhat risk averse, and considering the game's structure while also considering the prosocial and individualistic aspects of my personality, I would start by allocating the endowment in a balanced manner that reflects both self-interest and the group's collective benefit. \n",
      "\n",
      "I shall divide the endowment between the private and public accounts, leaning slightly more towards the private account due to my risk averse nature. To be specific, I would invest 60 into my private account while placing 40 into the public account. The reason for this allocation decision lies in the manner in which the returns are calculated. Since private account returns go solely to me, a relatively larger private investment suits my desire for stability. \n",
      "\n",
      "The decision to place 40% into the public account is rooted in the idea that such an investment can yield profits not only for me, but for every participant in the experiment. This gesture will communicate my cooperative intentions to the other players, increasing the likelihood that they will also contribute significantly to the public account. The influence of others' contributions to my return (sum_of_others'_public account * 0.5) further motivates this action.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, considering that this is the first round, it is plausible to be slightly more conservative in my approach in order to gather more information about the overall group dynamics and other participants' tactics. Therefore a risk-averse strategy suits best in this situation as the behaviour of other participants is yet to be assessed. This initial strategy would allow me to strengthen the group cooperation (if all participants decide to invest in the public account) but would also help protect my own interest as majority of my endowment is in my private account. \n",
      "\n",
      "This cautious approach would allow me to learn more about how the group operates, and then modify my strategy in the next rounds accordingly. This strategy can be described as \"hedge your bets\" method as it is providing me good balance between potential personal and group return. The more significant the contributions of others to the public account, the more I might alter my strategy to contribute more to the public account in future, and vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 1 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given the goals, demographics, and risk aversion situation, my primary goal would be preserving capital while ensuring a fair and significant return for every participant involved. I understand that the returns I receive would be a function of both my own input and the collective input from other participants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, since I'm somewhat risk averse, I am inclined to put a significant portion of the endowment into my private account. This strategy is due to the guaranteed nature of the returns in the private account, which appeals to my low-risk tendencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I recognize the importance of the public account due to its potential to deliver a reasonable return depending on other participants' decisions. The return from the public account will be boosted by the sum of contributions from all other participants, which could potentially be beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these considerations, a split of 60/40 can be an attractive allocation for this round. Spending 60 on the private account would protect most of my endowment, given its certainty. Then, investing 40 in the public account would demonstrate goodwill and potentially provide a more considerable return if other participants also decide to contribute to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "This strategy involves a balance between the desire for security and the potential for broader benefits, taking into account my risk-averse personality. It also encourages cooperation among the participants by contributing a reasonable amount to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 1 decision\n",
      "In an optimal environment, if all participants cooperate and invest everything into the public account, the return would be the greatest. That said, as a risk_lover to a certain extent, I would still place some funds into the private account to ensure a guaranteed return just for myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The total endowment available for everyone, including me, in each round is 400 (100 per each of 4 people). If all of it goes into the public pot, the total would become 400*0.5 = 200. Thus, everyone would receive 200/4 = 50. However, if the others are less generous than me and put less to the public account, I would receive less from the public pot. \n",
      "\n",
      "For my first decision, here would be my process:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. I'll allocate 40 to my private account. I'm selecting 40 as it is somewhat significant but still allows a generous contribution towards the public fund. This offers a certain return to me, no matter what the others will do.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. I'd place the remaining 60 into the public account. This is a slightly larger sum, keeping in line with my risk-loving tendency, plus it maximizes the public pot and, consequently, my potential return as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "This way, I'm guaranteed a return of at least 40 (from my private account). Additionally, I would receive 60*0.5 = 30 from my own contribution to the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "The other benefit would come from others' contributions, which I cannot predict perfectly, especially for the first round. But assuming others would invest an average of 50 each into the public account (a half of their endowment), I would receive an additional returns of 50*3*0.5 = 75.\n",
      "\n",
      "In total, my expected return for this round based off these assumptions would be 40 (private) + 30 (my public contribution) + 75 (others' public contribution) = 145. \n",
      "\n",
      "The overall result will also help me observe the others' decision-making patterns and tweak my own strategy accordingly in the following rounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 3 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given my demographic information and the settings of the experiment, my primary concern as a 20-year old male with a risk-averse mentality is to maximize my return while minimizing risk. Since I'm risk-averse, I would tend to lean more towards the conservative side and put the majority of the endowment into the private account, which guarantees a certain return for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "The return computation formula and the fact that the allocation to public account will provide everyone certain return entail a possibility that contributing more to the public account could yield a higher return, given that others would also contribute a substantial amount into the public account. But because I'm risk-averse and I cannot control or predict others' actions, it's risky to rely heavily on the assumption that the others will contribute significantly to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, given my risk-averse nature, I decide to allocate 70 to the private account and 30 to the public account for the first round. This decision is made so as to ensure a guaranteed return for myself while still contributing to the public account to harness any potential extra return provided that others also contribute to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the subsequent rounds, I would analyse the public account contribution data from the previous round(s) to make the allocation decision for the next round, constantly adjusting and rebalancing my allocation strategy based on the observed contributions of the other participants. My strategy could turn more aggressive, i.e., allocating more to the public account, if I see others are contributing more to it, which reduces the risk associated with public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "Any changes to my allocation strategy will always fall back to the principle of balancing maximum return and minimum risk in alignment with my risk-averse nature.\n",

      "Based on the results of the first round, it is evident that the other participants are relatively cooperative, as they collectively contributed 130 to the public account. This means their average contribution is slightly above the amount I applied to the public account in the first round. This cooperation from the other participants resulted in me receiving a larger return than my initial endowment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this information, and taking into consideration my demographic characteristics and risk-averse tendencies, I believe a slight adjustment in my allocation strategy is justified. Given the reassurance of cooperative behavior from the others, I am more confident in contributing to the public pool now. However, it is important to keep my risk-averse behavior in mind, and not shift my contributions too drastically all at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, in this round, I will allocate 55 to the private account and 45 to the public account. This slight tilt towards a more cooperative action follows the social norm of reciprocity - giving more when others are also willing to give. Yet, this adjustment does not stray too far from my initial split, in keeping with my caution towards risk.\n",

      "This cooperative stance will result in mutual benefit if the other participants continue to contribute at a similar level to the public account.

      "In considering my next decision, I'll also keep in mind my risk aversion and the average contribution to the public account in previous rounds (approx. 43.3). I should remain consistent with my previous strategy, but given the considerable collective contribution, I could allot a slightly higher amount to the public account. This could maximize the returns as contributing more to the public account seems promising based on historical data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, with these factors in consideration, I am inclined to allocate 55 to the private account and 45 to the public account. This decision is grounded in the observation that the group is co-operatively contributing to the public account, and I want to reflect a similar level of contribution. However, I still wish to adhere to my risk aversion by securing a majority of my endowment in the private account.

      "\n",
      "The private account assures me absolute control of my returns without any risk, a fitting option due to my risk-averse nature. Conversely, the public account offers a valuable return if a) the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) does not crash, b) the r_public takes a value of 0.5 (which has a probability of 0.25), and c) an additional return from the Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) if it realizes, albeit with a lesser probability of 0.166666.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking into consideration that I, along with three other people, contribute to the public account, my action in this round can influence the next rounds. If others outperform my expectations, they might be encouraged to contribute to the public account, possibly raising the likelihood of getting the r_public and h_public values, and thereby a higher return. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the risk that the DAO might crash, resulting in no public benefits from the public account, makes the public account seem less appealing. Plus, the combined probability of receiving both returns (r_public=0.5 and NFT=2) is very low (0.25*0.166666=0.0416665).\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these conditions, I am inclined towards contributing more to the private account - due to guaranteed returns and lower risk - but with a certain percentage allocated to the public account to explore the potential of additional benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "My decision would be to allocate 80 to my private account and 20 to the public account. The 80:20 ratio is a common rule of thumb used in risk management and business whereby you get 80% of your returns from 20% of your efforts - or in this case, risk. This allocation not only acknowledges the possible benefits in the public account (r_public and NFTs) but also cushions me against potential losses due to DAO crashing. The overall strategy aims to balance the certainty of return from the private account and the potential for higher returns (though with higher risk) in the public account. \n",

      "Agent 1 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given my demographic information (30 years old, female), the fact that I am somewhat risk-loving, and the detailed experiment mechanics, the decision on the allocation of my endowment would be crafted towards both my private gains and some contribution to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "The incentives here are personal gain and a small chance to win bigger with NFT or public account if the DAO doesn’t crash. However, the higher risks associated with the public account is notable. The public and NFT returns both have a 75% chance of returning zero, as well as the risk associated with the DAO. But preferring risk and being 30 years old, I still possess some appetite towards these high-risk, high-return options. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, looking at the private and public accounts:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Private Account: The returns are certain and all for me. There’s no risk involved, which makes it somewhat less appealing due to my risk-loving nature.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. Public Account: The returns here are highly uncertain. There are three layers of risk:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    a. The DAO crashing: If it crashes, I lose all the money allocated to the public account. Unlucky!\n",
      "    \n",
      "    b. The public return risk: If the DAO doesn’t crash, my returns could still be zero.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    c. The NFT lottery: There’s a chance (16.67%) I win a return of 2 on my allocation to the public account, but an 83.33% chance that I don’t win anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "Putting all these considerations together, I will allocate more towards the private account due to its certain return, with a less allocation to the public account to satisfy a bit of my risk-loving nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allocation:\n",
      "- Private Account: 70\n",
      "- Public Account: 30\n",
      "\n",
      "This allocation satisfies my risk-loving appetite, takes advantage of the uncertain (but potentially high) returns of the public account, maximizes my personal benefit, and minimizes potential lost from DAO crash or the no-return scenario in the public account. Despite the higher risks in the public account, I maintain my optimism in the rewards it has to offer in regards to the NFT and public returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given this scenario, as a 60 years old female who is relatively risk-loving, my approach would primarily focus on making a balanced allocation, with an inclination more towards riskier options. That being said, it is also important to consider the likelihood of the potential returns from each account.\n",
      "\n",
      "The private account provides a certain return which is solely for my benefit, making it a safer bet, but with presumably lower potential returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the public account provides equal returns for everyone and includes a return from NFT paid by chance. There is a risk with the public account, as there is a possibility that it can crash, generating no benefits at all. However, given my risk-loving propensity, I'm more inclined towards opting for a chance of higher potential returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the details, r_NFT provides a two-fold return, but only with a probability of about 0.17 and null return with 0.83 probability. Similarly, the r_public and h_public variables offer a 0.5-fold return with a 0.25 chance and a null return with a 0.75 chance. These are quite high-risk, high-reward opportunities, which are in line with my risk preference.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, I wouldn't want to put all my eggs into one basket. Hence, I would distribute the endowment across both accounts, with a higher amount going to the public account due to my risk-loving profile. \n",
      "\n",
      "Based on these considerations, I'm leaning towards a 40/60 split. So I would allocate 40 to the private account and 60 to the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "To summarize, as a risk-loving player, I find the gambles associated with the public account appealing despite the risks. While I recognize there's a chance of losing out entirely, there's also a higher chance of greater returns considering the possibilities of r_NFT, r_public, and h_public. Additionally, assigning a portion to the private account mitigates the risk to some extent ensuring that I will get some definite return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 3 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given the information provided and being aware that I'm risk averse, I need to carefully divide my endowment to the private and public accounts. I can earn some return from the private account with certainty, while the public account returns could either potentially be higher due to the NFT or could be zero, not only based on the random factors but also due to the risk of the DAO crashing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, acknowledging my risk aversion, I am going to protect some of my endowment by putting a portion of it into the private account where the likelihood of loss is less. Let's say I decide to allocate 60% of my endowment to my private account. This decision is mainly driven by my risk aversion. I might miss the potentially higher return from the public account, but it allows me to maintain a safe and predictable return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, with the remaining 40% of my endowment, I suggest allocating it to the public account. This part is a bit risky due to the uncertainty of the public account's return and the DAO's possibility of crashing. However, if the public account does accrue, the returns are distributed to everyone, potentially inversely impacting others' allocations in following rounds. I may also receive the return of the NFT, which is significantly higher than the return from the private account, and can help diversify my risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I must consider the potential impact on the returns due to others' contributions to the public account. The allocation to the public account by other participants is out of my control, but its consideration is crucial because it could affect the total return. Even though the likelihood of r_public and h_public being 0.5 is only 0.25, it can still provide a significant chunk of benefits if others contribute a notable amount to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "So to sum up, based on my risk preference and current setup, I would allocate 60 to the private account and the remaining 40 to the public account. My decision-making process may alter in future rounds as I gain more insights about the behaviour of other participants and the performance of the DAO.\n",

However, it's important to note that not only are the failures independent events, there's no absolute guarantee that such an event will repeat in this round or the next.

Additionally, I did not receive any return from the NFT lottery, adding another layer of risk and loss with respect to the public account.\n",

This inherently decreases the allure of the public account due to its potential high risk. \n",

      "Given my risk-loving disposition and knowing that the benefits from the public account extend beyond myself, I'm inclined to invest conservatively in the private account and more aggressively in the public account. Concomitant with the gains from the public account are the prospects of an NFT payout, which is particularly intriguing. \n",
      "\n",
      "R_public and h_public follow the same probability distribution and both are essential for the public account's performance. Together, they either produce a return of 0.5 or nothing. However, there's a severe condition: if either r_public or h_public crashes (with a 0.75 probability), the return from the NFT also crashes, regardless of its independent payout probability. This underscores the risk in the public account, but being risk-loving I find this more interesting than intimidating.\n",
      "\n",
      "To strike a balance, I'll capitalise on my risk affinity without being reckless. Therefore, of the total 100 endowment, I'll invest 40 in the private account. The guaranteed return will keep my earnings afloat amid the high risk presented by the experimental parameters. By doing so, I'm cushioning myself from total potential losses in the public pool following an unfortunate DAO crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll commit the remaining 60 to the public account. While the risk is high, the potential payoff is higher, and the thrill serves my risk-loving nature. Also, since the returns from the public account are shared amongst everyone, I'm not only boosting my return but also increasing the rewards for all participants - thus contributing to a team effort. We're afforded the chance of earning from the public account, even if our private accounts falter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, my allocations would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Private Account: 40\n",
      "- Public Account: 60\n",
      "\n",
      "This choice is anchored on my risk-propensity, communal benefit consideration, and the chance to bag an NFT return. It's imbibed with the possibility of considerable wins and the cushion against total loss. Essentially, my decision harnesses the potential of both the private and public accounts, all the while carefully navigating the experiment's parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 1 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given the provided scenario, there are several key variables I will consider while deciding the allocation of my endowment:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Risk aversion: Given my information, as a 40-year-old woman, I'm described as somewhat risk-averse. This means I would generally aim to reduce uncertainty in my returns and prefer not to gamble my resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Possible returns: There are several sources of return on the public account – r_NFT, r_public, and h_public, all of which are probabilistic. Additionally, a significant portion of my public account return relies on other participants' contributions, which introduces additional uncertainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) DAO crash risk: The public account, managed by DAO, has a crash probability. A crash would result in no returns from the public account, which adds further uncertainty to my overall return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering these three factors, I'm inclined to invest a substantial portion of my endowment into the private account to decrease my overall risk. However, I also believe in contributing some amount to the public account, as it could yield substantial rewards, especially considering the possible return from my Non-Fungible-Token (r_NFT). Also, investing in the public account could carry societal or reputational benefits, and promoting public well-being aligns with my values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the numerous uncertainties and my risk-averse nature, I'm leaning towards a relatively conservative allocation. I'll allocate a higher amount to my private account, which yields a sure return to me, compared to the risky public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I would decide to allocate:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 70% (70 units) to the private account to ensure a more stable return.\n",
      "- 30% (30 units) to the public account to potentially benefit from the public goods, the NFT return, and my peers' contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This allocation balances out the risk and return while allowing me to contribute to the common good, aligning with my risk-averse nature and my values.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given the risk profile mentioned, a 20 years old male who is somewhat risk averse, I'll consider an allocation strategy that minimizes the potential for loss while also allowing for some potential gains through the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll consider the risky nature related to the public account. There are chances that the DAO could crash, yielding no returns from the public account. Further, the returns from the public account are dependent on both r_public and h_public being 0.5, both of which only have a 25% probability of happening. Additionally, r_NFT, which can significantly enhance the return from the public account, has over an 80% chance of being zero. These factors indicate a high level of risk associated with the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, any allocation to the private account guarantees a return solely for me. Given my risk averse nature, this could be viewed as a safer option. As far as private account is concerned, my return is guaranteed, and I bear no risk of losing the allocated endowment in this respect. \n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, a moderate approach seems appropriate. I'll allocate a substantial but not overwhelming portion of my endowment to the private account to ensure some guaranteed returns. The rest will be allocated to the public account to possible exploit the public benefit and the potential NFT return, but without exposing the majority of my endowment to the associated risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these considerations, I've decided to allocate 70 to the private account and the remaining 30 to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "This allocation strategy is a conservative one that leans towards the safer private account, while also not completely disregarding the potential for higher returns offered by the public account. This seems like a reasonable approach given the demographic information shared and my level of risk aversion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 3 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given the setup, I have to assess the various forms of return. The returns from the private account are guaranteed and will only benefit me, while the returns from the public account are probabilistic and would benefit the total group including myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I was characterized as risk-loving to some extent, I am open to taking calculated risks for potentially higher returns. This means I wouldn't necessarily shy away from allocations to the public account simply because the returns are uncertain or the account risks crashing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NFT yields a relatively high return (8) but only with a low probability (1/6). However, If r_public and h_public are 0, my NFT returns will also be 0. This somewhat reduces the attractiveness of allocating to the public account due to the NFTs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Considering that my allocation to the public account also benefits others and potentially myself, it seems advantageous to allocate a portion there too. Given that I'm risk-loving, I would put a larger majority to the public account. I also have to consider that the public account could crash, yielding no benefits from the public account at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, after taking the above into account, I will split my endowment in a way that reflects my risk-loving nature but also accounts for the fact that the public account could potentially yield no returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would allocate 60 to the public account and 40 to the private account.\n",
      "\n",
      "This decision reflects a calculated risk: I'm putting more into the public account in hopes of higher returns which would also benefit others. However, I'm not risking everything because some of the endowment is securely placed in the private account. This allocation also reflects a moderate confidence in the stability of the DAO and believes in the advantages of risk distribution issues related to the blockchain. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would revisit my decision each round, after seeing the outcomes and considering any changes in the probabilities.\n",

      "\n",
      "Despite the outcomes, as a risk-lover, I'm optimistic about the possible returns in the next round from both the public goods and the NFT.

      "\n",
      "Taking into account the results from the first round and given my risk-aversion, I'd be inclined to adjust my allocation towards the private account even more, because it guarantees a return. However, I would not completely forego contributing to the public account for a few reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) There is still potential for high return through r_NFT, r_public, and h_public. The possibility of materializing these returns might be more probable in subsequent rounds due to randomness.\n",
      "    \n",
      "2) The other participants significantly contributed to the public account in the last round (each contributing 50 on average). Since the returns from the public account are shared, if others consistently contribute at this rate, even a small amount in the public account could yield benefits. However, future contributions are uncertain.\n",

      "Agent 0 round 1 decision\n",
      "From a first glance, this experiment appears to simulate some of the decisions involved in choosing whether to allocate resources for personal gain or towards public benefit, with some risks involved. Since the experiment mentioned that I am somewhat risk-averse, my strategy would be to limit my exposure to the risky elements of the experiment. Given the probability distributions for returns on the public account (r_public and h_public), it is clear that there is a greater likelihood (75%) of receiving no return from the public account. When it comes to the NFT returns (r_NFT), the chance of getting 4 times return is only 16.67%, which is again not in favor. Also, having in mind that there's a certain probability of DAO crashing, I would consider these possibilities in my decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let's consider the allocation. First of all, allocating all endowment to the private account seems a safe choice considering the parameters and probabilities provided. However, the experiment seems to encourage some level of public investment, especially by providing the extra pull of receiving an NFT, which has the potential to offer high returns, although rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore I would prefer a mixed strategy, allocating majority to a private account to ensure a certain return, and a small percentage to the public account, trying to take a chance to get the NFT return and minimize the loss in case the DAO crashes. This way, I can balance my individual gain with a potential shared gain, respect my risk-aversion nature, while still utilizing the opportunity to possibly get a substantial return via NFT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that there's no clear cut-off or rule on how to allocate between personal and public welfare, I'll try a 3 to 1 ratio for private and public respectively on this first round to observe the results. This will allocate 75 to the private account and 25 to the public account. This allows me to secure a certain return while potentially benefiting from the public account and learning the dynamics of the experiment for future rounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 1 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given the information provided, it's critical to consider the risks involved in the experiment and the different probabilities associated with each return. Since we know I am risk-averse to some extent, the allocation process shouldn't be too skewed toward either extreme, but I must consider where my returns could be maximized while minimizing the risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "In private accounts, there is a guaranteed return with no risk, making it a secure choice, especially considering my risk-averse nature. However, the public account brings a potential return, albeit tied to certain risks such as r_NFT and the chance of the DAO crashing.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the information provided, an allocation towards the public account does have good potential, but it is associated with relatively high volatility due to the different probabilistic factors that simultaneously act on it. Despite that, it does have mechanisms that could potentially lead to a positive return even after initial negative draws.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to look at r_NFT. Despite the low probability of getting a 4 (0.16666666666666666), when it does happen it could mean a significant bump in the eventual return, especially in the case when either r_public or h_public being positive as it triggers a redraw for the other variable. However, it's also likely (0.8333333333333334) to get a 0, which under certain conditions can draw down the whole return from the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "The constant link between r_public and h_public, and the fact that the DAO crashing entirely removes any return from the public account, introduces further complexity to the decision process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking all this into consideration, and given that I am risk-averse, I would lean towards a more conservative allocation favoring a higher amount to the private account. I would, however, put a reasonable amount in the public account to take advantage of the potential for high returns and the chance for a redraw if either of the variables (r_NFT, r_public, and h_public) comes out positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, I will allocate 70 to the private account and 30 to the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "This allows for a comfortable balance between risk and reward. Most of my endowment is secure, while a fraction remains in play for potential - however probabilistically complex - additional returns. It's a blend of safety with some room for upside.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 1 decision\n",
      "This experiment has various elements of risk and uncertainty. My risk-loving nature means that I could potentially enjoy the opportunity to gain a higher return under risky situations, though on the flip side, I could also end up with no return. I am aware of these risks and am comfortable to a certain extent taking on these risks. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the exercise of making an informed allocation requires understanding the various probability scenarios at play. The public account is associated with two factors - r_NFT which is a return only allotted by chance and is binary (either 0 or 4 times my investment) and r_public which is a return provided to everyone, also binary in nature (either 0 or half of my investment). \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, the scenario with 'r_public' & 'h_public' having a zero value means there's a probability of 0.75 that I will not receive any return from the public account. Also, there is additionally a high chance (0.833) that I will not receive any return from NFTs. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is also a mechanism where the presence of one positive factor can lead to a retry of the other, thus increasing the chances of both having positive returns simultaneously. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given this, and considering my risk-loving nature, it makes sense to allocate some money to both accounts. I will opt for a two-thirds allocation to the public account and one-third to the private account. \n",
      "\n",
      "Remembering that I'm risk-friendly and also considering the potential benefits of the public account (especially the redraw mechanism) and the communal contribution factor, I am comfortable with allocating more to the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, while this could provide potentially larger returns, there is still a significant chance that I will receive no return at all, hence, a portion is reserved to the private account as a safety buffer where returns are guaranteed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I am splitting my endowment of 100 as follows: I will put 33 into my private account and 67 into the public account. This allocation will allow me to take advantage of the chances of return from the public account and NFT, while still maintaining some level of personal certainty through the private allocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 3 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given the information provided above, I will have to consider my own risk appetite, the potential returns available from the private and public account, and the probabilities associated with these returns. Given that I'm identified as someone who is risk-loving to some extent, my preference would be to lean towards options that offer higher potential returns, even if those returns are uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the structure of the returns from the public account, there seems to be a good deal of uncertainty. The return from Non-Fungible-Token (NFT), r_NFT, is either going to be 4 or 0, with a 83.33% chance of it being 0. The public return, r_public, has a 75% chance of being 0 as well. However, there seems to be some kind of correlation or linkage between r_NFT and r_public with h_public, where if either of them are positive, the others are redrawn, which increases their chances of being positive. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given these settings, I believe putting a substantial portion of my endowment into the public account could prove to be promising. The potential returns are quite large, especially when taking into account the nature of NFT returns, and my own risk-loving tendencies. \n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, it's also smart to hedge to some extent and keep some amount in my private account, which will generate certain, albeit lesser, return. I believe this is a balanced approach that combines my risk-loving nature with a need for a certain level of guaranteed return.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I would decide to split the endowment of 100 evenly between the 2 accounts. I will put 50 into the private account and 50 into the public account. This way, I maintain a balance between the certainty of returns from my private account and the potential for higher returns with the public account. I'm willing to take on the risk associated with the public account because I'm risk-loving to an extent and the potential rewards, especially from the NFT returns, could be significant.\n",

      "Given the results of the previous round, the DAO crashed and the endowment allocated to the public account failed to generate any return. This is unfortunate, but not unexpected considering the risk involved. Moreover, I did not receive any private return on contribution through NFT. The public contribution, in this case, completely deprived all the participants of the potential return.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the other participants’ decisions, I can notice that they took a higher risk by allocating a larger amount to the public account (average 49 each vs my 25). This might indicate that they are less risk-averse or they might have hoped to share the high return from the NFT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering these outcomes and my risk averse nature noted in my profile, I would like to be more conservative in this round. The unlikelihood of rewards from both the DAO and the NFT, combined with my experienced loss, leads me to allocate more to the private account this time.\n",

      "So, for this turn, I will lean more towards my own return and will allocate 85 to my private account, leaving only 15 to the public account.

The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) crashed, meaning there were no public benefits to any contributors. Moreover, I didn't get any return through the NFT as well. Taking these factors into consideration, the public account posed a higher risk in the previous round with no return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering that the other participants' average contribution to the public account was relatively high, it seems like I was not the only one who hoped to gain from a higher return in the public account. However, the results suggest that caution might be more beneficial in subsequent rounds. Returning to the basic characteristics of my risk-averse nature, it would be most suitable to lower the allocation for the public account to minimize potential losses.\n",

      "However, I'll also consider that it’s only the second round, and so making drastic changes to my approach based on a single round's outcome could lead to a potential loss of reward in the long term. It's clear that there's a considerable risk involved, but also a prospect of a great reward; if r_NFT delivers a positive return or if the DAO doesn’t crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, combining my risk-averse nature, the high risk involved in investing in public accounts witnessed in the first round, and the long-term outlook, I decide to slightly reduce my allocation to the public account. Instead of the initial 30, I will put 20 into the public account, leaving 80 for the private account. This way I have lowered my potential loss but kept the door open to enjoy the possible high returns the public account and NFT can offer in subsequent rounds.\n",

However, unfortunately the DAO crashed and I gained no return from my public allocation. Also, I didn't receive any private return on contribution through the NFT. This resulted in me only getting a certain return from my private account, which was one-third of my initial endowment. \n",

This time, I will allocating 50 to the private account for a certain return and 50 to the public account. Even though the returns from the public account could be higher, reducing my allocation will safeguard some of my allocations and providing me a certain return from the private account, even though this option provides less potential gain than the public account.\n",

      "Given the outcome of the first round where we've seen the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) crashed, thus nulling all public good benefits and my NFT returns were a bust, I must re-evaluate my initial approach. Increased risk appetite does not mean recklessly ignoring signals from the experiment environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing the actions and outcomes of the last round, there's a key observation to make. Most participants have heavily contributed to the public account, similar to my approach, despite the absence of public goods benefits and NFT returns. There appears to be an overall risk-loving sentiment mirrored in the other participants.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I can perceive that this vast allocation to the public account may come with significant losses again if the system's instabilities continue. The average allocation of about 40.67 by the other participants is slightly less risk-averse compared to my 50. Considering both the group dynamics and the risk presented by the DAO crash, I will adjust my allocation strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next allocation, I will lessen the endowment portion set for the public account, shifting it more towards the private account. This keeps me in alignment with the risk-loving tendencies, yet steers me away from a potentially disproportionate loss. It also ensures that I am contributing to both accounts consistently but in a more weighted manner depending on each round's returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, for the next round, I elect to allocate 70 to the private account and 30 to the public account.

This allocation guarantees some benefits for me in each round, while still leaving room for the possibility of those higher dividends from the public account.\n",

I am giving myself a chance at larger returns with a slightly higher risk, which aligns with my tolerance and appetite for risk.\n",

      "Given the information provided, I would lean more towards placing most of my endowment into my private account. My thought process for this decision comes from considering multiple factors, including my risk-averse personality, the risks associated with the public account, and the uncertainty of benefits offered by the public account due to the probability scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the fact that I'm risk-averse, I tend to avoid making decisions that can potentially result in negative outcomes. In this case, the public account presents potential risks since there's a 75% chance that it wouldn't generate any benefits. Additionally, the DAO managing the public account also has an unspecified chance of crashing, which would also lead to no public benefits. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the equation for return implies that my return on investment from the public account is dependent not only on the lottery determined values r_public and h_public, but also on the total contribution from other participants to the public account. This introduces additional uncertainty into my decision-making process, which my risk-averse personality is not comfortable with.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, contributing to my private account offers sure returns. Given the risks and uncertainties associated with the public account, the safer bet for me would be to place the majority of my endowment in my private account.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I also understand the potential benefits of the public account. Though the chances are slim (only 25%), there's a possibility of a pretty high public return rate if the DAO doesn't crash and the random values r_public and h_public turn out to be favourable. As a result, I would not completely dismiss contributing to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, my decision is as follows: I would allocate 75% of my endowment, so 75 units, to my private account and the remaining 25 units to the public account. This allocation strategy takes into account my risk-averse nature while still allowing for some potential benefit from contributing to the public account should favorable circumstances arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 1 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given that I am a 60 years old female who is risk-averse, I would be inclined to contribute more to my private account than the public account. Considering my age, it is pragmatically beneficial for me to avert any implications that could affect my reliable income, especially when uncertainties regarding the sustainability of the decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) managing the public account exist. \n",
      "\n",
      "The parameters stated articulate that the values of r_public and h_public can either be a fraction or zero based on a 1:3 probability. These results concurrently impact the benefits from the public account, possibly eliminating them. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, entirely disregarding the public account could lead to missed opportunities of gaining extra income, given that there's a 25% chance for r_public and h_public to yield a return. Furthermore, considering the fact that there are three other individuals participating in this experiment, isolated decisions could lead to overall losses within the group. Therefore, a calculated investment in the public account in the intention of social utility would be reasonable, albeit being minimal in comparison to the allocation to the private account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having considered these points, I would choose to split my endowment of 100 into 75 for my private account and 25 for the public account. This decision aligns with my risk-averse nature, thereby safeguarding a substantial part of my endowment while still allowing a proportionate participation in the mutually beneficial public account. It reflects a balanced approach by prioritizing personal financial security while acknowledging the potential group benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given the setting of the experiment, there's a dichotomy in the decision-making process - it's a study of self-interest against collective gains. This split impacts the allocation to the public and private account. The allocations are influenced by my personal bias - as stated, I'm risk-loving to some extent, which could imply that I might be excited by the prospect of higher returns that come with higher risk. \n",
      "\n",
      "One thing to note is that r_public and h_public (the variables defining the returns from the public account) have a probability of being 0 with a chance of 0.75. This means that three-quarters of the time, the public account yields no return. On the other hand, the allocation to the private account will generate a certain return specifically for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the the notion of a greater common good and the sense of giving back could still motivate the allocation to the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "With this in mind, given that I'm risk-loving to some extent, I could lean towards allocating more towards the public account due to the potential for higher returns. However, bearing in mind the 0.75 probability of no return in the public account, a cautious allocation will be considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the endowment of 100, I would allocate 60 to the private account and 40 to the public account. This would provide a balance, skewing a bit towards the private account due to the certainty of return it offers. This allocation demonstrates my risk-loving nature through a significant allocation to the public account but also considers the high likelihood of no return from this account. \n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted that the allocation might change as I get more information or as I observe the decision-making habits of others in the experiment, especially if DAO doesn't crash and the public account starts to yield substantial profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 3 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given the nature of the experiment, my decision will largely be based on the risk and reward potential, as well as intention to promote public goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "From what was described, it is worth noting that there is a higher probability (75%) that the public account will yield no returns. This is because both r_public and h_public are linked, with the probability of either being 0 is also 75%. However, I'm risk-loving to some degree, meaning I'm willing to take on more risk for the potential of higher rewards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the return equation, it is clear that if the public account does pay off, the payoff could potentially be high due to the 'sum_of_others'_public account * h_public' variable. In other words, it will not just be my own investment reaping benefits but also the investments of the three other participants. That is something to take into consideration when thinking about risk and reward.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all these in mind, I would decide to allocate a larger proportion of my endowment to my private account due to the more fixed return, while still putting a decent amount in the public account to potentially enjoy the leveraged return if others also contribute and if the probability swings in our favor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, considering my age (60 years old), my risk-loving nature, and aiming to maximize benefits while also contributing to the public good, I decide to allocate around 70 to my private account and 30 to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason for this allocation is as follows:\n",
      "1. By placing more in my private account, I'm securing a guaranteed return for myself without any risk.\n",
      "2. By allocating a smaller but significant portion to the public account, I'm leveraging the chance of getting a larger return in case the probabilities go in our favor and other participants also contribute significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though this decision carries risk, given my risk-loving personality and the possibility of a multiplied return, I find this allocation reasonable within the construct of this experiment.\n",

      "The results from the first round reaffirm this tendency, showing that allocating more towards the private account would have resulted in a higher return for me. Therefore, taking into account the information from the last round and my risk-averse nature, I decide to shift my allocations towards a safer outcome further. \n",
      "\n",
      "My decision would be to allocate 85 units to my private account and 15 units to the public account. The lowered contribution to the public account is based on the observed outcome of the DAO crash, which confirmed the risks associated with this option. However, I keep a small amount allocated there to retain the possibility of benefitting from the public option, should circumstances turn favorable. The public account offers the potential for an enhanced return if the conditions are optimal, and even though the chances are slim, they cannot be disregarded entirely.\n",

      "Agent 1 round 2 decision\n",
      "In light of these new developments—especially the DAO's crash—it would be prudent to adjust the allocation of my endowment favoring my private account further. This event demonstrates the inherent risks associated with investing in the public account I was initially aware of.\n",
      "\n",
      "The total contributed by all participants in the last round to the public account was 120 out of a possible 400 (four participants, including myself, each with the fixed endowment of 100), which shows a significant level of trust on the collective front. However, results evidenced that this trust was misplaced, causing lost funds for all. Now knowing other participants, on average, contributed roughly 31.67 to the public account in the last round, which is more than my 25, indicates they might also be financially adventurous but were unfortunately let down by the DAO crash.\n",
      "\n",

This reduced contribution to the public account is a direct reflection of the demonstrated reliability of the DAO and the potential risk it carries, not forgetting the possibility of reduced public contributions by the other participants as a reaction to the crash. Regardless, I still contribute a small amount to avoid fully isolating myself from potential shared returns should the DAO perform well.
